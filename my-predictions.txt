# I can take a look at the trends and compare them to what I thought at this time later, once there's more data


My own take (early July):

up on recent trends (and late rounders):
	isaiah crowell - late round flier (could be lead back on Browns)
	kamar aiken - steve smith doesn't give a fuck, so he could be main receiver
	melvin gordon - so low after last year, good late round flier
	eric ebron - was decent last year and Megatron gone = more targets
	jared cook - maybe? is now a receiver for one of the best qbs
	martellus bennet - now has tom brady tossing him the ball
	lamar miller - good rb on a run-first offense
	jay ajayi - could be a 3 down back now that lamar miller is gone
	ladarius green - has ben throwing to him now, also with martavius bryant gone, less crowded
	duke johnson - competing against isaah crowell who has never been great, while johnson was good on his few carries before and great for ppr
	rashaad jennings - could be the lead back (again much like last year near the end) and is super cheap


down:
	david johnson - it's the CJ anderson of last year, just not enough games to be in the top 5, and not enough projected snaps for a first round workhorse
	todd gurley - hard to trust with such a shitty team, maybe they've gotten better and can support him. also pretty young
	ezekiel elliot - don't go for a rookie in the first round or two. too much risk (melvin gordon last year)
	brandon marshall - getting old
	demaryius thomas - floating too high off name recognition, too much risk as seen last year
	randall cobb - not sure whether jordy nelson coming back helps or hurts him (history would say helps, but that was mostly tds)
	ryan matthews - they claim committee
	allen hurns - most of his output last year was tds, can't sustain
	tyler eifert - most of his output last year was tds, can't sustain

up:
	jordy nelson - not listed high enough cause he was gone last year
	lamar miller - would take ahead of a lot of the rbs ahead of him
	eddie lacy - really low as "fat eddie"
	mike evans - will get more tds this year than given credit for cause of last year
	mark ingram - why is he so low? did they pick up another rb?
	lesean mccoy - same question as ingram
	cj anderson - some risk of committee again, but he's down too far from the committee problem last year
	thomas rawls - with lynch retired, he's basically got that backfield on lock
	kelvin benjamin - joining back on a superbowl caliber team after a year gone (albiet it was superbowl caliber only in the time he was gone), and was a top 12 before, draft as a top 15
	josh brown - other receivers are getting old out there and he had some great times in the early season last year before a slump
	derek carr - did great at qb last year, was solidly consistent, not sure why he's so low
	tyler lockett - was doing well last year, and returning yards again possibly (just for gw league)
	gio bernard - is listed low and could continue to take over role from hill
	donte moncreif - similar to reasons for pickup last season, good sleeper posibilities
	stefon diggs - possibly the top minessota wr? need to check, possibly worth late round flier
	andy dalton - way down there on the qbs, why?
	justin forsett - if not committee, worth late round flier, wasn't that great last year in same situation though. could look for something with more upside
	rashaad jennings - if not committee, worth late round flier? kind of sucked last year in the same situation though. could look for something with more upside
	markus wheaton - with martavius bryant gone for the season, might be too low for ben's #2 option

See where you compare to different consensus:
	base to compare against (usually want to use whatever list your hosting site is using, say yahoo's list if your fantasy league is hosted there)
	other list to compare against (usually want some reputable other list that you want to take into account, like fantasypros consensus or your favorite commentator's list or something)
	pick from the base list, where you think certain players should go (with a rating of "way down", "down", "no movement" [default], "up", "way up"), with the second list blind if you like
		compare your choices with the other list to see how well you align for confirmation or ideas
